🐍 Snake Water Gun Game (Python)
A beginner-friendly Python terminal game based on the classic Snake, Water, Gun — a fun variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

🎮 Game Rules
🐍 Snake drinks Water → Snake wins

💧 Water douses Gun → Water wins

🔫 Gun kills Snake → Gun wins

Same choice by both → It's a draw!

💻 How It Works
The computer randomly picks one of the three choices.

The user enters "snake", "water", or "gun".

The choices are mapped to numbers using a dictionary.

Conditional statements determine the winner.
